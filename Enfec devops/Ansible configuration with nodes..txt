1.Lanch 3 ec2-machines in aws like (ansiblecontrolserver,node1,node2)
2.install ansible in the ansiber server with the following commands.
i) sudo yum install epel-release
ii) sudo yum install -y ansible ---> check whether installed by using ansible --version
3.goto the /etc/ansible/hosts
# vi /etc/ansible/hosts and give private of node1 and node2 with [group name] 
4.goto " vi /etc/ansible/ansible-cfg" uncomment the permission of inventory and sudo_user=root
5.add "ansible user" for all the instances with the useradd command also set password for the user using passwd(in both the nodes).
6.goto ansible user with "sudo su - ansible" --> by default for ansible user there will not be any sudo priviliages so we are giving ansible user as sudo priviledges by using "visudo" 
7."ansible   ALL= (ALL)      NOPASSWD: ALL" --> under root priviledges.
8.do the same process in node1 and node2 in ansible user.
9.For allowing node machine to access with the username and password providing privileges.,
"sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config by using"
uncomment passwordAuthenication and make the permisssion as "yes".
10.after configuration we need to restart the sshd service with " sudo systemctl restart sshd " do it for all the machines.
11. Switch to the ansible user and generate public and private keys by using "ssh-keygen" command in "ansiblecontrolserver"
12.In order to configure the node machines we are copying the public key in both nodes to establish connection between them.
"ssh-copy-id  ansible@<private ip of node1>" --->in ansiblecontrolserver
"ssh-copy-id  ansible@<private ip of node2>"----> in  ansiblecontrolserver
13.ansible all -m ping  (or) ansible all --list-hosts.
